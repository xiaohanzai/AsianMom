# Asian Mom is watching you!
## -- a mixed reality game that lets you enjoy the childhood of Asian kids

This is a mixed reality game created for oculus quest 3.
Player assumes the role of an Asian kid whose mom comes into their room every once in a while to check whether they are studying, but of course the player is not supposed to study.
Player will complete a series of goof-off activities without being discovered by their Asian mom to pass each level, and the levels get more difficult with mom checking in more frequently.

This gif shows one of the goof-off activities player needs to complete (whack-a-mole on your own floor), and before mom enters into player's room player needs to stop playing to avoid being discovered.
